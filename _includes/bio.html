Data and the beautiful insights obtained from it have always fascinated me. As a part of my graduate studies I have gained knowledge in the field 
  	of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural language processing, Database Systems, Probability and Statistics. Th<a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a> and <a href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~pal/">Philip Levis.</a>
  	<p> I have worked with a bank Tele marketting data, using which I predicted whether a person is a potential customer for opening a long term deposit account in the bank. This was a classification problem in which various algorithms like SVM, perceptron, probabilistic Minimum Risk Bayes classifier and Deep Neural networks were used. Apart from this I have also worked with unlabelled data 
  	from a wholesale distributor in which I applied probabilistic clustering method like Gaussian Mixture model in order to segment the target customers on the basis of their spending habits so that the distributor can make optimal delivery schedule with maximal profits and minimal loss. Sentiment analysis for hotel reviews was also done by me using the Naive Bayes and perceptron algorithm. 
  	The sentiment hidden in the reviews for books on Amazon was done by me in order to predict the quality of a particular book.  </p>
  I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California. affiliated with the <a href="http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/"> Stanford DAWN</a> project. I am broadly interested in efficient and effective data analytics for large-scale, machine generated data. My recent projects include automatic smoothing parameter selection for time series visualization and earthquake detection through 
  efficient time series similarity search.  </p>
 <p>I graduated from Caltech in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Before that, I attended Nanjing Foreign Language School in Nanjing, China.</p>
