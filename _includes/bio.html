  	<p><img alt="pic" style="width:180px;float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;" src="/assets/img/me.png">I am a Master's student at the University of Southern California, studying the Data Science concentration and will be graduating in 3 months. Data and the beautiful insights obtained from it have always fascinated me. As a part of my graduate studies I have gained knowledge in the field 
  	of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural language processing, Database Systems, Probability and Statistics. </p>
  	<p> I have worked with a bank Tele marketting data, using which I predicted whether a person is a potential customer for opening a long term deposit account in the bank. This was a classification problem in which various algorithms like SVM, perceptron, probabilistic Minimum Risk Bayes classifier and Deep Neural networks were used. Apart from this I have also worked with unlabelled data 
  	from a wholesale distributor in which I applied probabilistic clustering method like Gaussian Mixture model in order to segment the target customers on the basis of their spending habits so that the distributor can make optimal delivery schedule with maximal profits and minimal loss. Sentiment analysis for hotel reviews was also done by me using the Naive Bayes and perceptron algorithm. 
  	The sentiment hidden in the reviews for books on Amazon was done by me in order to predict the quality of a particular book. There are many more projects that I have done. For full portfolio, reports and code follow the Projects tab above. </p>
 <p>I am particularly interested in Exploring data which leads to creating probabilistic models for Bayesian Machine Learning. Creating insights and predictive models by using Machine learning is something I enjoy too. For full profile check out my linkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">Ruchin Patel</a>.
