I am currently building a recommender System using the Amazon purchase dataset. 
This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014. It includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs). For more information about the dataset visit <a href="http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html">Amazon purchase dataset</a>. 
I plan on using Apach-Spark, Py-Spark on AWS via the Zeppelin notebook since the data is huge and cannot be handled in a normal local computer. To look at the project proposal follow this <a  href="/papers/Recommender_System_project_proposal.pdf"  style="font-weight: bolder;"> Link </a>.
