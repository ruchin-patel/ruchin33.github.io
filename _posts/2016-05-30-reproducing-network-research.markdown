I wrote a <a href="https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/2016/05/30/cs244-16-self-clocked-rate-adaptation-for-conversational-video-in-lte/">blog post</a> on reproducing results from the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2631976">SCReAM paper</a>. SCReAM (Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia) is a rate adaptive, delay-based congestion control algorithm devised mainly for conversational video services under LTE environment.
